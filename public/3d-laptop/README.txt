This folder is intended to hold the 3D laptop model files.

Currently the original model files are still in `public/desktop_pc/`.
To complete the rename, move the following files from `public/desktop_pc` into this folder:
 - scene.gltf
 - scene.bin
 - license.txt
 - textures/ (all files)

If you prefer, I can attempt to copy the files for you, but large binary assets may be handled better using a local filesystem move or Git client.
